!!meta-define:brief:Hmm~ hmm~ wouldn't it be loverly?

<div style="text-align: center">
All I want is a room somewhere

Far away from the cold night air

With one enormous chair

Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Lots of chocolate for me to eat

Lots of coal makin' lots of heat

Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Oh, so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still

I would never budge 'til spring

Crept over me windowsill

Someone's head restin' on my knee

Warm and tender as he can be

Who takes good care of me

Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Loverly, loverly~

loverly, loverly.
